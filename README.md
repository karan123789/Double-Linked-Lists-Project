# Double-Linked-Lists-Project




This Python project focuses on implementing a robust set of operations for managing a double linked list (DLL). The project includes a Node class with data, previous node, and next node attributes, and a DoubleLinkedList class for managing DLL operations with methods for adding nodes at the beginning, end, or a specified position, removing nodes by value, position, or conditions, finding nodes by value, converting the DLL to and from a Python list, and a unique "Dream Escaper" function that transforms a multilevel DLL into a single-level DLL by integrating child nodes into the main list.



Functions I did in this project include: empty, push, pop, list_to_dll, dll_to_list, _find_nodes, find, find_all, _remove_node, remove, remove_all, reverse, and dream escaper

NOTE: Rest of the functions were pre-defined and provided to me when completing this project and were not completed or changed by me

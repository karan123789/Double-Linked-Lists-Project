# Double-Linked-Lists-Project




This Python project focuses on implementing a robust set of operations for managing a double linked list (DLL). The project includes a Node class with data, previous node, and next node attributes, and a DoubleLinkedList class for managing DLL operations with methods for adding nodes at the beginning, end, or a specified position, removing nodes by value, position, or conditions, finding nodes by value, converting the DLL to and from a Python list, and a unique "Dream Escaper" function that transforms a multilevel DLL into a single-level DLL by integrating child nodes into the main list.
